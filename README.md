Testing out a map app
https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/?product=javascript&topic=any

October 30th update - 

My interest in developing with the Arc-Gis Mapping Api has somewhat dwindled. Too man restrictions at the higher functionality level. (in regards to directions). So I will be testing other Map Api's out. Should have just made a new repo, but likely I'll just rename this for my map api attempts 

So now I will be exparimenting with the Google Maps Api. 

acctually 10 minutes in forget Google Maps. They have this wired free/priced system where you have to give them a credit card to use the API and you get something to the effect of $300 free....per month. 

I think I'll hold off on Google Maps for the time being. 

Let me try Map Box and Openstreetmap !
